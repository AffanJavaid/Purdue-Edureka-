I have 2 branches 1 is master and I have created new branch B1 from master.
I have made changes in master branch and now wants to merge these changes in B1.

Following are the types of merging 

1- Merge (Fast Forward)
It will merge all the commit history of master branch on top of B1 branch as it is. If 5 commits are in master 
than 5 commits will be on top of B1 branch.

2- Rebase 
It will merge all the commit history of master branch on top of master branch previous history. And then all 
the commit history of B1 branch. If 5 commits are in master than 5 commits will be on top of master branch. And 
then commits of B1 branch. 

3- Squash
It will merge all the commit history of master branch as a single commit on top of B1 branch. If 5 commits are in master 
than 1 commit will be on top of B1 branch.
